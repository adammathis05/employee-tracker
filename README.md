# employee-tracker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to use PostgreSQL to create and manipulate an employee database. The functions allow the user to view all depts, roles, and employees, as well as add to each section. I was able to finish most of the functions but didn't have time to get them all done. However, this was a great exercise in learning to integrate JS and SQL and I enjoyed seeing the functionality work. It was also fun to try out using async await. I will plan to complete the other functions so that the app is fully complete at a later date.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
